# Hello-World
My 1st repository.
I am an investment advisor.
I plan to build my career in Data Science and have just started on this journey.
I delivered a baby recently and am a full-time mother currently. 
As much as I'm enjoying this phase of my life, I also want to get back to my old life- working and partying and working and partying.
I'm in love with food- love trying out different items on the menu; checking new restaurants in town; not averse to try street delicacies too.
That's all about me :)
